Remembering Python

Aug 13, 2019

Python: the language that we all praise as the best beginner friendly language. Python was my favorite programming language last year. It was one of the first languages I actually learned. I started to branch off into building websites so I put Python on the back burner while I focused on HTML, CSS, & JS. I also took on frameworks like Rails and Angular among technologies like Node.js.
I was steering towards being a jack of all trades but I wasn’t interested in knowing a little of everything. I really want to be a pro at one thing and then develop from there.
Having gone through the Python tutorial again, I forgot how humanlike the code was and it almost speaks to the user so that basically anyone with a basic understanding of code can understand versus many of the other languages that are out there.
I’m considering to get back into Python to hone my skills. Python has great potential and I would like to get into more automation.

Penetration Tester

Aug 13, 2019

I’ve been watching a penetration testing beginner course (~15 hours long) and it has been very educational so far. I’m 6 hours into the video.
There is so much material in this video that it would be impossible to go through it all in one sitting without it numbing your brain. In essence, information overload.
As the video proceeds, I find myself questioning myself what I expected from this video. Here I thought it was all tools and programs to download and it would do 99% of the work. This is where I was more wrong. Penetration testing is not only tools, it is also using your problem solving skills and thinking out of the box. Many times tools fail to find information so you have to think about what you are trying to achieve and what tools do you have at your disposal to achieve that whether it be a tool or what you know from experience.

Diving into something new: Ethical hacking

Aug 12, 2019

I’ve been watching a penetration testing beginner course (~15 hours long) and it has been very educational so far. I’m 2 hours into the video.
The topics covered are installing Linux for ethical hackers (Kali Linux), an intro to Python, several tools and lessons for ethical hacking and command line commands among other topics.
This is by far my favorite subject in everything I’ve spent time studying and practicing. It has always been a passion of mine being a penetration tester. It’s fascinating how someone developed their network topology, website, database, etc... even the physical security.

What's the difference between 'bundle exec jekyll serve' and 'jekyll serve'?

Aug 9, 2019

bundle exec jekyll serve - Runs the exact Jekyll server version that is specified in your Gemfile/Gemfile.lock.
jekyll serve - Runs some version of Jekyll server, which may or may not be the one you want.

Functional Theme

Aug 8, 2019

Finally got a solution to the default theme from breaking on GitHub pages. The CSS file is now working as intended.
In the config.yml file, I changed baseurl: "" to baseurl: "/" .

Further Into Jekyll Themes

Aug 7, 2019

Further reading into themes, each theme has its own layout unique to the way it is built. This means that I have to modify each page that I want to display with this layout with a special layout. The default theme, Minima, has 4 layouts while the one I was looking to install has 1. This makes me wonder if there is something I am missing. Is the one layout just a bare bone layout intended for me to manipulate to my needs? I will continue to search for an answer.
Here is a link to a YouTube video that demonstrates what I tried.

Jekyll Compatibility Issues

Aug 7, 2019

I’ve been working on trying to configure another theme for the blog, but I can’t seem to get past the compatibility issues between GitHub Pages, Jekyll and the gems. It appears that the update schedule for the different components differ greatly. All I can do is look harder for a solution. A workaround is not off the table.
In the meantime, I have this blog working after about 5 attempts trying to change the theme through GitHub only to have the site go blank (I.E. nothing displays on the main page). Some attribute that do to the hard coded nature of some of Jekyll’s coding. It was a lot of trial and error at the beginning and nothing was very successful.
There is a ton of modifications to be done visually with the standard layout that comes boxed with any new project. Still lots of things to learn with Jekyll. Not quite there yet.
